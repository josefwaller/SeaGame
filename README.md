SeaGame
=======

A game where you build supply chains between different marine bases, and slowly grow your navel empire
as you aquire more technologies, money and resources.
Working fine, but I had trouble getting the game to be fun, so it never got past the prototype stage.
Uses SFML, TGUI, Box2D and rapidxml.
Features include inventories, save files, physics, combat, and crafting.

## To Run

* Set up SFML by downloading it and putting it in the `SFML-2.4.2` folder.
* Set up TGUI by downloading it and putting it in the `TGUI-0.8` folder.
* Download Box2D and put it in the `Box2d` folder
* Open the VS solution and run it
